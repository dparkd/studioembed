					<p class="label">Tools for creativity</p>
                    <p class="label"><i class="gray">Creation, Editing, AI, Conversational</i></p>
					<p>I've always been interested in building and designing tools for creativity. The best tools in the world are one's that speak for themselves and have affordances that don't require too many instructions. All tools should allow for progressive mastery, but on the surface simple enough to enable creativity.</p>
                    
                    <br><br>

                    <p class="label">Playful interfaces</p>
                    <p class="label"><i class="gray">Play, delight, interactions, spice</i></p>
					<p>As a craftsperson, I care deeply about building and designing the most beautiful products for other craftspeople. My focus isn't to just solve the problem, but to create delightful software. When you're designing for creatives, the tool needs to be intuitive, look good, and feel good.</p>

                    <br><br>

                    <p class="label">Re-imagining Paradigms</p>
                    <p class="label"><i class="gray">Operating Systems, paradigms, blue-sky thinking</i></p>
					<p>Recently, I've had this thesis that all software needs to be redesigned from the ground up. Old affordances and interfaces don't adapt well to the changing landscape of innovation. I am on a mission to redesign and re-imagine all software for the modern day.</p>

                    <p class="label"><i class="gray">Download and mind meld</i></p>
					<p>Before touching any design tools or pixels, I want to make sure that I'm on the same page. I'm going to be reading all your key documents/presentations, listening to your user interviews, chatting with you, and testing out your product.</p>
