		<p class="bold uppercase" style="text-align: left;">ITEM 1.  &nbsp;&nbsp; OVERVIEW</p>
		<p class="justify">
			As Charles Eames put it, “The details are not the details. They make the design.” The best products are crafted with meticulous attention and care. At Studio Embed, we exist to push the boundaries of interface design. Guided by a principle-first approach, we prioritize craftsmanship in every step of the process. If it's not something we would use ourselves, it's not worth presenting. We design our interfaces for the craftsperson in us.

		<p class="bold uppercase" style="text-align: left;">ITEM 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;  PROCESS, CAPABILITIES, AND SCOPE OF WORK</p>
		<p class="justify">
			The best way to explain how we work is by comparing it to a tennis rally. Just like in a rally, you want a partner who can challenge you while keeping the game enjoyable. We serve as your rally partners in creativity. A partner who can adapt to where you are in your journey will help reignite inspiration in both you and your product. With that in mind, here's how the process unfolds if you choose to work with us:
		</p>
		<table class="list">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td class="dot"><p>•</p></td>
					<td><p><i class="italic">To kick things off, you serve the ball.</i> You'll onboard us to your product, your vision, and your team, treating us as if we're joining as a founding designer.</p></td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td class="dot"><p>•</p></td>
					<td><p><i class="italic">Next, we'll analyze what you sent.</i> We take a deep dive into the information and figure out how to create a body of work that will either inspire you or address the problem.</p></td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td class="dot"><p>•</p></td>
					<td><p><i class="italic">Then, we hit the ball back.</i> We present our findings and proposed solutions in the form of a prototype or slide deck.
					</p></td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td class="dot"><p>•</p></td>
					<td><p><i class="italic">Finally, you decide your next move.</i> You can either choose to iterate on what we've developed or end the engagement.</p></td>

		<p class="justify" style="font-style: italic;">
			“dpark is one of a kind at conjuring up stunning mobile interfaces from scratch. He dreams up interactions that make you giggle with excitement, and points the way towards ideas that are inspiring in their audacity, and bracing in their clarity. He is the first person I have come across who treats interface design as an artistic craft, and has the intense skills to back that up — which means he is a serious weapon for any early stage product team.” – <i class="italic">Sahil Handa, CEO @ Typo</i> 
		</p>
		<p class="justify" style="font-style: italic;">
			“There’s no one better on the planet at utilizing the space of an iPhone and crafting intuitive designs that elevate the phone in to a much more inspiring device. Dpark’s interfaces are art and deserve to be in a museum.” <i class="italic">– Dan Lilienthal, Co-founder @ [untitled]</i>
		</p>
		<p class="justify" style="font-style: italic;">
			“Daniel’s searchlight capabilities are next to none. Company momentum is accelerated with the concepts and product ideas he produces. He understands how creative tools should be made and how to make them the most playful.” <i class="italic">– Joseph Cohen, Co-founder and CEO @ Universe</i>
