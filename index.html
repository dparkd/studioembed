		<h2>STUDIO EMBED.</h2>
		<h4 class="italic">A STRATEGY AND DESIGN PARTNER FOR CREATIVITY</h4>

		<div class="links">

		</div>

		<div class="rule-partial"></div>

		<p>I am a partner who can expand possibilities and navigate the ambiguous. Studio Embed's thesis is to answer questions by asking more questions. This is manifested through searchlight exploration and low level creativity. There are three principles that Studio Embed carry: <i class="italic">craft from design first principles,</i> <i class="italic">explore the unknown,</i> and <i class="italic">enable creativity.</i> The reason why I named my practice Studio Embed is because I optimize for high touch collaboration. While I design craft products, I am also embedded in all aspects of the culture and company. I strive to produce an environment of craft and excellence for workflows, collaboration, and product execution.</p>

		<p>If you are a founder, company, or builder who cares about building a taste-led product, then you loop me in. Good enough is not enough anymore. You pull me in when you are serious about building experiences that cut through the norm with a high level of craft and taste. I am a design strategist who can trigger excitement, invoke inspiration, and produce creative energy.</p>

		<h4>TYPES OF ENGAGEMENT</h4>
		<h4 class="no-margin">Available q3 2024</h4>

		<p>This is not an exhaustive list of studio capabilities, but a list to give you a good sense of what type of collaboration would work. Although this is a list of things I could do, I much prefer meeting with you in real time to discuss what type of creative collaboration we can explore. I will tailor my partnership with you.</p>

		<h4>TESTIMONIALS</h4>

		<p><a href="http://typo.by" target="_blank">Typo</a> is where I discovered there's a fundamental paradigm shift that is needed for digital communication. As their first design hire, I helped define and build the vision together with the team from scratch. Typo is currently gearing up for a public launch in March of 2024.</p>

		<table class="list">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td class="dot"><p>•</p></td>
					<td><p>“dpark is one of a kind at conjuring up stunning mobile interfaces from scratch. He dreams up interactions that make you giggle with excitement, and points the way towards ideas that are inspiring in their audacity, and bracing in their clarity. He is the first person I have come across who treats interface design as an artistic craft, and has the intense skills to back that up — which means he is a serious weapon for any early stage product team.” <i class="italic">– Sahil Handa, CEO</i></p></td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<p><a href="https://untitled.stream" target="_blank">[untitled]</a> is where I learned that craft tools have as much value as utility. Artists care about how their tools look and feel. As their founding product designer I revitalized [untitled]'s existing product and produced a five year vision. As of today, my efforts contributed to five figure user growth and product market fit.</p>

					<td><p>“There’s no one better on the planet at utilizing the space of an iPhone and crafting intuitive designs that elevate the phone in to a much more inspiring device. Dpark’s interfaces are art and deserve to be in a museum.” <i class="italic">– Dan Lilienthal, Co-founder</i></p></td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<p><a href="https://onuniverse.com" target="_blank">Universe</a> was instrumental in helping me define my design practice. At Universe, I started developing the thesis that tools should be playful and delightful. Some of these tools won an Apple Design Award.</p>

		<table class="list">

				<tr>
					<td class="dot"><p>•</p></td>
					<td><p>“Daniel’s searchlight capabilities are next to none. Company momentum is accelerated with the concepts and product ideas he produces. He understands how creative tools should be made and how to make them the most playful.” <i class="italic">– Joseph Cohen, Co-founder and CEO</i></p></td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<p><a href="https://about.meta.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> is where I developed core skills on how to navigate ambiguity and produce clarity. During my time there, I shipped three 0-1 products that contributed to $1M daily recurring revenue.</p>

					<td class="dot"><p>•</p></td>

		<h4>INTERFACE RESEARCH</h4>

		<p>Below are a collection of interface and interaction research that showcase a first principles approach. With each of these, I hope to explore more deeply the way that designers should think about interfaces instead of simply using a component from a set of libraries.</p>
