					<li><i>“dpark is one of a kind at conjuring up stunning mobile interfaces from scratch. He dreams up interactions that make you giggle with excitement, and points the way towards ideas that are inspiring in their audacity, and bracing in their clarity. He is the first person I have come across who treats interface design as an artistic craft, and has the intense skills to back that up — which means he is a serious weapon for any early stage product team.” </i> Sahil Handa, CEO</li>
